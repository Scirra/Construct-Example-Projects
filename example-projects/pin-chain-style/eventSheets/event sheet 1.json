We cannot write an event which says 'Attach Sprite to different Sprite', since 'Sprite' always refers to the same object in this event.  Instead, there is a family called SpriteFamily which only has the Sprite object in it.  This allows us to separately pick a different Sprite object and refer to it with SpriteFamily.  The instance variable is also added to the SpriteFamily so it can be accessed from both (the Sprite object will inherit all its family's variables.)"
