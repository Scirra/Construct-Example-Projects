Towering trees form a natural cathedral, their intertwining branches creating a dappling effect of sunlight on the forest floor.\n\nThe air is thick with the scent of earth and moss, and distant whispers of rustling leaves add to the symphony of nature.\n\nAs you venture deeper, the path narrows, and the sunlight filters through the dense canopy, creating pockets of gentle illumination."

The ancient stone figure, partially obscured by vibrant green moss, depicts a mystical creature with outstretched wings and a watchful gaze.\n\nTime has weathered its features, and the moss, like a verdant cloak, tells tales of centuries past. As sunlight filters through the dense canopy, the statue emanates an otherworldly aura, casting a soft, ethereal glow around its base.\n\nYou wonder if someone back in the village might have some more information. Maybe you can find more clues back in the [b][color=blue]Tavern[/color][/b]."
