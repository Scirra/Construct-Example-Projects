1. Grant of license

Licensor and their partners retain all right, title and interest in and to all of the copyrights, trademarks, and all other proprietary rights in the Licensed Content. All rights in and to Licensed Content not expressly granted in this agreement are retained by Licensor or their suppliers.

Licensee may use the Licensed Content in commercial projects as long as Licensee has an appropriate paid license for Construct during the use of creating Works For Distribution with the Licensed Content. Distributed and/or published Works For Distribution do not require an active Construct paid license.

Licensee is permitted to use the Licensed Content in unlimited Free Projects. A Free Project is one defined as a Work For Distribution that generates zero revenue, has generated zero revenue and does not have the capability to generate revenue in any form including advertisments that are in the same direct enviornment as the Work For Distribution (for example, a banner advert above a game).
