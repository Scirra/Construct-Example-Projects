# Construct example projects
This repository contains all the example projects that appear in [Construct](https://www.construct.net)'s Example Browser, saved as folder projects. This is intended to allow for browsing and searching through the code examples using JavaScript and TypeScript in particular using GitHub's interface.

Coding examples have a '-js' suffix on the folder name when they use JavaScript, and a '-ts' suffix when they use TypeScript. Folders with neither suffix generally use event sheets only.

Some examples may show compatibility warnings when opened from this repository. Some examples are old and when opened from the Example Browser Construct will suppress compatibility warnings and automatically update them to the recommended settings. This will not happen if you open them outside of the Example Browser and it is recommended to immediately apply any identified compatibility changes.
